# Arrays

An array is a collection of items stored at contiguous memory locations. The 
idea is to store multiple items of the same type together. This makes it easier 
to calculate the position of each element by simply adding an offset to a base 
value, i.e., the memory location of the first element of the array 
(generally denoted by the name of the array).

For a vector with linear addressing, the element with index i is located at the 
address B + c Ã— i, where B is a fixed base address and c a fixed constant, 
sometimes called the address increment or stride (where the stride is base off 
of value type ie. u8 or i32).

If the valid element indices begin at 0, the constant B is simply the address 
of the first element of the array. For this reason, the C programming language 
specifies that array indices always begin at 0; mainly referenced as the 
"zeroth" index rather than "first".

However, one can choose the index of the first element by an appropriate choice 
of the base address B. For example, if the array has five elements, indexed 1 
through 5, and the base address B is replaced by B + 30c, then the indices of 
those same elements will be 31 to 35. If the numbering does not start at 0, 
the constant B may not be the address of any element.

# Linear Search

Linear Search is defined as a sequential search algorithm that starts at one 
end and goes through each element of a list until the desired element is found, 
otherwise the search continues till the end of the data set.

Steps in a linear search:
1. Every element is considered as a potential match for the key and 
checked for the same
2. If any element is found equal to the key, the search is successful and the 
index of that element is returned
3. If no element is found equal to the key, the search returns None

Example with integers:
``` python
def linear_search(arr: List[int], target: int) -> Optional[int]:
    # loop through array -> i in range(len(arr))
    # if i == target return i
    # else return -1
```

# Binary Search
Binary Search is defined as a searching algorithm used in a sorted array by 
repeatedly dividing the search interval in half. The idea of binary search is 
to use the information that the array is sorted and reduce the time 
complexity to O(log(N)).

Iterative approach
``` python
def binary_search(arr: List[int], target: int) -> Optional[int]
    # 1. Compare target with middle element

    # 2. if x matches with the middle element -> return 
    #    middle index

    # 3. if x is greater than the middle element, then x 
    #    can only be in the remaining right half after 
    #    the middle element. Then apply the algorithm again

    # 4. if x is smaller than the middle element, then x can 
    #    only be in the remaining left half before the middle 
    #    element. Then apply the algoritm again
```

## Advantages of Binary Search:
* Binary search is faster than linear search, especially for large arrays.
* More efficient than other searching algorithms with a similar time 
  complexity, such as interpolation search or exponential search.
* Binary search is well-suited for searching large datasets that 
  are stored in external memory, such as on a hard drive or in the cloud.

## Drawbacks of Binary Search:
* The array should be sorted.
* Binary search requires that the data structure being searched be 
  stored in contiguous memory locations. 
* Binary search requires that the elements of the array be comparable, 
  meaning that they must be able to be ordered.

## Applications of Binary Search:
* Binary search can be used as a building block for more complex 
  algorithms used in machine learning, such as algorithms for training 
  neural networks or finding the optimal hyperparameters for a model.
* It can be used for searching in computer graphics such as algorithms 
  for ray tracing or texture mapping.
* It can be used for searching a database.
